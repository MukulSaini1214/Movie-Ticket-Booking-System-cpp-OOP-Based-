A console-based movie ticket booking system implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming principles. The project features role-based access for customers and managers, with functionality for movie scheduling, seat booking, cancellation, and revenue tracking. Data is stored and loaded using CSV files for persistent storage. Demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, access control, STL usage, and file handling in C++.

## Features
- User Registration and Login System
- Role-based Access: Customer and Manager
- Seat Booking and Ticket Cancellation
- Movie Scheduling with Automatic Expiry
- Revenue Calculation and Admin Dashboard
- Data Persistence with CSV File Handling
- Demonstrates Encapsulation and Inheritance (OOP)

## Technologies Used
- C++
- STL: map, vector, string
- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Inheritance)

## How to Run
1. Compile the code with a C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
2. Run the program in a terminal

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++** – Core programming language.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)** – Used for data structures: `map`, `vector`, `string`, etc.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Inheritance, encapsulation, static methods, access specifiers.
- **File I/O** – CSV file handling using `fstream`.
